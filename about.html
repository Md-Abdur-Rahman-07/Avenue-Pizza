        <section class="about-history">
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1995, Avenue Pizza started as a small family-owned pizzeria with a passion for crafting
                authentic, handcrafted pizzas. Over the years, we've grown into a local favorite, known for our
                commitment to fresh ingredients and time-honored recipes.</p>

            <p>What began as a humble pizza shop with a single oven and a handful of cherished family recipes quickly
                became a go-to spot for pizza lovers. Word spread about our crispy, hand-tossed crust, signature
                house-made sauces, and generous toppings, and soon, we had a loyal community of customers coming back
                for more.</p>

            <p>Through the years, we've expanded our menu to include a variety of specialty pizzas, fresh salads,
                appetizers, and mouthwatering dessertsâ€”while staying true to our original promise of quality and flavor.
                Despite our growth, we remain dedicated to the same family values that started it all: great food, great
                service, and a welcoming atmosphere.</p>

            <p>Today, Avenue Pizza is more than just a restaurant; itâ€™s a place where friends and families gather to
                share delicious meals and create lasting memories. We take pride in our history and look forward to
                serving our community for many more years to come.</p>
